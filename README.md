the home is where u start of  from there ucan navigate arounfd using the help logo feture  on the top left corner i would have had another link in there but to lack of timing i cannot add the register link wer they would have been able to sign up.

- __The home page__

  the home page consisits of the nav bar, the logo link in the nav bar, a video and footer, this the main page and the purpose is to inform you of how change can be made through the video and more information i would have provided but wasnt able due to loss of tim and lack of experience using git pod and others.

  there is a main logo for the web page on the background and a video informing how some one had turnt themselves around and how you yourself are the oly limit to your possibilities.
   i would have centered the video and had it alot smaller but due to lack of time im having to go ahead.
